# About Me

## My Interests

In my free time I enjoy fiber arts, especially crocheting. I just learned how to do mosaic crochet. I have my hands full with two cats and a dog all under the age of 2. Outside of crafting and being a pet-mom, I love to cook and learn new recipes or play video games with my boyfriend. 

## Websites I Recommend

- [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel) - I enjoy using Adobe Color for many reasons. I use it to create color palettes for logos, apps, and websites. I also use it to ensure that my color palettes pass accessibility standards. The "extract theme" tool is useful for finding exact hex numbers to use in projects. 

- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) - YouTube is helpful when trying to learn new topics, especially in an online classroom platform. I am a visual learner, so I find the video format to be beneficial to my learning style.
